Yes! In AWS, **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** can **automatically know and register EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling Group**. This is one of the key benefits of combining ELB + Auto Scaling.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

### âœ… How It Works
When you create an **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**, you can specify a **Target Group** or directly an **ELB**.  
The ASG will automatically:
- **Register new instances** to the Load Balancer when they are launched.
- **Deregister instances** from the Load Balancer when they are terminated.
- **Perform health checks** and remove unhealthy instances from the Target Group.

So you donâ€™t have to manually register/deregister instances when scaling happens.

### ðŸ”¥ Example Architecture
Auto Scaling Group â†’ linked to Target Group â†’ attached to an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** or **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**.

### ðŸŽ¯ Quick Summary
| Component | Role |
|:-:|:-:|
| Auto Scaling Group | Automatically adds/removes EC2 instances |
| Target Group | Holds healthy instances for the Load Balancer |
| Load Balancer (ALB/NLB) | Distributes traffic to instances in the Target Group |
